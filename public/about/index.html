                I am a self taught Web Developer.  My journey into web development and coding began due to a combination of things and circumstances.  
                Initially I would pinpoint it mostly to curiosity.  Triggered by spending time in California’s Silicon Valley where my 
                partner lives. From being inspired after reading Sheryl Sandberg’s book ‘Lean In’. And having been a casual 
                travel blogger, I had the desire to spruce up the design of my travel blog website with the goal to having my own domain for it and 
                more control. Thus began my journey into teaching myself with online resources and courses how to be a programmer. 
              </p>

            <p class="bio__text  bio__text--2 mb-sm">
              In truth this passion project is still laying in wait on the cutting room floor so to speak, although not actually discarded, just 
              postponed for now, while I have been busy building up my skills and experience and turning this new found love of coding into a career! 
                <br>
              I am so grateful I started down this road, the journey has been so rewarding and I love the challenges and thrill of successes it brings 
              day in, day out.  I am a ‘why’ person, I love to know how things work, and I think that is part of the sense of achievement and 
              accomplishment I get as I learn new things, the curious girl inside of me thrives on it!
            </p>
            <p class="bio__text bio__text--3 mb-sm">
              My background prior to becoming a web developer ranged from numerous hospitality gigs spanning from highschool through to my University 
              days, where I studied a Bachelor of Arts in Film and Screen Production at Griffith University in Australia. I have always enjoyed 
              practical and hands-on work, often with a creative and/or technical element.  Some years were then spent with my own business doing 
              bookkeeping and tax compliance work, and prior to my transition to developer, I spent 5 years as a Travel Consultant for Flight Centre 
              Travel Group, making customers holiday dreams come true.  
            </p>
            <p class="bio__text bio__text--4 mb-sm">
              Travel is still very close to my heart, I have most definitely been bitten by the travel bug, to which I don’t seek a cure. I absolutely 
              love the way travelling can change you, and open up your eyes to new things, new experiences, different cultures and an appreciation for 
              the unknown.  We don’t know what we don’t know, and until some new experience or journey takes us to that place. No experience is ever a 
              waste, as long as we take something from it, this goes for the good and the bad.  I apply this to my coding and learning journey all the time.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__text bio__text--5 mb-sm">
              My other hobbies include cycling, tennis, reading, movies, writing and cooking yummy and healthy foods (yes I believe the combination is 
              absolutely possible!).  I am always trying to one-up myself in the kitchen, and improve on each dish I prepare and learn from it for the 
              next time.  I’m very big on home cooking when possible, and including nutrient dense ingredients in each meal for better health, focus 
              (for coding of course!) and longevity.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__text bio__text--6 mb-sm">
              One of my favourite things about my journey of learning to code, is that I can see that it will be a life-long journey, the learning of 
              new things will never really stop.  There is so much to learn, so many different ways to improve my skills and build upon my 
              foundation and then branch off in new directions when it feels right. In an ever changing industry, I may never, ever feel I 
              have finished learning, and that is just part of the appeal.
